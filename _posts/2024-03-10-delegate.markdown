`Delegate` is a type that represents references to methods (pointer to methods). It allows methods to be passed as parameters, stored as variables, and invoked indirectly. Delegates are a powerful feature of languages like C# and are often used in event handling, callbacks, and implementing various design patterns.

Delegates provide a way to achieve decoupling in your code, allowing you to change the method being called without changing the code that calls it. They are widely used in event-driven programming and the implementation of callbacks.

We have three built in generic delegates:
1. Func: It takes a generic input and returns generic output
2. Action: It takes a generic input and returns nothing
3. Predicate: It takes a generic input and always returns Boolean

These generic delegates are used extensively in built in classes of .NET and we can use them to make our delegates shorter
