`Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on representing real-world entities as objects that have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP aims to provide a structured and modular approach to software development.

The key concepts of OOP include:

- `Classes and Objects`: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of objects. An object is an instance of a class, which can hold data (attributes) and perform actions (methods).

- `Encapsulation`: Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object or class). It provides data hiding and abstraction, ensuring that the internal state of an object is accessible only through defined methods.

- `Inheritance`: Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. It establishes a parent-child relationship between classes, where the child class (subclass) inherits the characteristics of the parent class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and supports the "is-a" relationship.

- `Polymorphism`: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (providing a different implementation in a subclass) and method overloading (providing multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).

- `Abstraction`: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and generalized view of objects and their interactions. It involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only relevant information and functionality. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define common behaviors and establish contracts for classes to follow.

OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability by organizing code into reusable objects and establishing relationships between them. It allows for better code organization, separation of concerns, and easier collaboration among developers. OOP is widely used in various programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and C#.
