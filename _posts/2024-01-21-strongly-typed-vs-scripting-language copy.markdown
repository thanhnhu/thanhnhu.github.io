`Strongly typed language` (ngôn ngữ kiểu dữ liệu mạnh) vs `Scripting language`
can understand as `compiled language` (biên dịch) vs `interpreted language` (thông dịch)

Compiler has a type checking system to check the type while compiling, so it can detect the error first (ex: assign float to int var), scripting language get error at runtime.

Strongly typed language need to build the whole project, replace all the library, execute file when compiling, scripting language just replace the files that modified.
