#### Difference between Where vs Having
`Context`:
- WHERE is used to filter rows based on individual records before any grouping or aggregation.
- HAVING is used to filter the results of a query based on aggregated values after grouping.

`Usage`:
- Use WHERE for filtering individual records in a table.
- Use HAVING for filtering grouped results based on aggregated values.

`Aggregation`:
- WHERE typically involves conditions on individual columns.
- HAVING involves conditions on aggregated values obtained through aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
